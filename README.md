# AustinKeeseyLootGenerator

## Overview
The Purpose of Random Loot Generator is to provide awesome different combinations of loot that the player can be entertained by. The program runs the different combinations of loot and then the program writes the random generation. It accepts input from the user by letting them specify whether they would like another shot at different generated loot by saying yes or no. 


## High Level 
1.) Prompts the user if they would like some epic loot
2.) Loads a list of the different types of loot
3.) Loads the list of the different elements of the loot
4.) Loads the list of the different themes of the loot
5.) Randomly selects a type, element, and theme
6.) Write the random selection of the three combinations to the console
7.) If more loot needs to be generated by the user saying yes to more loot, go back to step 2
8.) Otherwise, the program exits




## Methods
Given a list of type, element, and theme, generate a random loot combination using only one entry from each list

1.) Create a random loot generator
2.) Generate a random number, TypeIndex, between 0 and Type.Count
3.) Generate a random number, ElementIndex, between 0 and Element.Count
4.) Generate a random number, ThemeIndex, between 0 and Theme.Count
5.) Combine the different aspects of the loot together
Type[TypeIndex] + " " + Element[ElementIndex] + " " + Theme[ThemeIndex];
6.) Return the loot
